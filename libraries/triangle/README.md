# Triangle Library

This module is from: https://github.com/drufat/triangle

It is included here so that it can be compiled on the fly for
newer processor types which the PyPi version has not been set up
for (i.e. aarch64). This library doesn't seem to have been updated
in some time either, but it is still the best (only?) kind I've found
for python without diving fully into CGAL, which maybe is worth doing
at some point in the future
